## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

You can use this repo's files as a starter to create a gitpod remote dev environment. Of note, copy the wasm-cloud-base folder for all the prebuild and docker compose magic, and copy the .gitpod.yml and .gitpod.Dockerfile for setting up the workspace image and prebuilds. If you need to make changes, see the gitpod website for references on the .gitpod.yml and [how remote dev environments work]([[https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml) .  (you can also use [JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/intellij), all you IntelliJ-Rust fans!)

## Notes & caveats
